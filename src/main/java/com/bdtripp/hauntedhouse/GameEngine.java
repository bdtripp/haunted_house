 *  Represents the GameEngine of the Haunted House game. Haunted House is a text based 
 *  adventure game in which the player can explore rooms in a haunted house. The goal 
 *  of the game is to try to find your way out of the house. This class contains the 
 *  core logic for the game that is shared by both the web version (GameService) and the 
 *  CLI version (CliRunner). It creates all the rooms, items, characters, defines the 
 *  exits for each room, and processes all Commands entered by the player.

            Hint(s): You will need to charge your beamer before firing it. Charge the beamer in a room that 
            you want to use as a return point. Later when you fire the beamer, it will send you back to the 
            room that you charged it in originally.

            Usage: type \"fire\" + \"space\" + \"the name of the item you want to fire\"

            room that you charged it in originally.

            talk: If there is a character in a room, you can use this command to talk to them.
            Usage: type \"talk\" + \"space\" + \"the name of the person you want to talk to\"
            Hint(s): N/A

            you found. You must be in the same room as the Character that you want to give an item to.""");
